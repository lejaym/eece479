Files for EECE 479 Project -- Winter 2013
Adapted from Steve Wilton, UBC

This directory contain some files that you might find useful
for your EECE 479 project.  There are two sets of files.

In the "specification" subdirectory, you will find stubs (templates)
that you should use when writing your Verilog specification.  You will
also find a testbench you can use to test your Verilog design.

The "cells" subdirectory will be used to store the layouts for
primitive cells as described in the handout.  The "layout" subdirectory
will be used to store the layout of the chip, again as described in the
handout.  The "layout" subdirectory also contains a .cmd file you can
use to test your top-level layout.  You will likely want to create your
own .cmd files to test the individual components.
