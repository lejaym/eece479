Verilog Templates for EECE 479 Project -- Winter 2013
Adapted from Steve Wilton, UBC

This directry contains the stubs that you should use for
your Verilog code.  If you use these stubs, then you will
be able to use the testbenches that we provide, and it
will make it easier for us to help you and mark your
project at the end.  If that isn't a good enough reason,
then consider this: anyone that *doesn't* use these
stubs without a good reason will cause us to be in a bad
mood when marking, and markers in a bad mood tend to
give lower scores.
